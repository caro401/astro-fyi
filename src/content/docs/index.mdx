      <p>I'm currently thinking out loud about</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/notes/weaving">weaving</a></li>
        <li><a href="/notes/learning-rust">learning rust</a></li>
        <li><a href="/notes/nyckelharpa">nyckelharpas</a></li>
        <li><a href="/notes/podorythmie">French-Canadian foot percussion</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and a bunch of other random topics. Sometimes I <a href="/notes/book-notes">read books and make notes on them</a>. Have a look around, search for something interesting
        or just browse the sidebar for a list of all notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a bit more <a href="/notes/about-these-notes">about these notes</a> to explain
        how they work.
      </p>
