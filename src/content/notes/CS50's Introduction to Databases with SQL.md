I'm taking [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://www.edx.org/learn/sql/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-databases-with-sql) on edX as a refresher, and a way to cement my fundamental knowledge of databases. I've used SQL a bunch, but never really formally sat down to learn things, so this should be good for me.
