Random cool tools and inspiration to use in static sites

- [Tweetic](https://github.com/zernonia/tweetic) is code to convert tweets to static HTML. It looks nice, but I'm not sure how well it connects back to the original tweets
- Code Hike's [video tutorial maker](https://github.com/code-hike/video-tutorial-maker) for doing coe walkthroughs. And also [code hike](https://codehike.org/) itself for using in blog posts or whatever with code examples. Shame it needs react though. - "scrollycoding" like scrollytelling
