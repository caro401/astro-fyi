Also known as shot. Pick can also refer to the action of passing the weft thread through the warp [[Shed is the opening formed when warp threads are separated|shed]].

A single picking operation can result in more than one pick (thread) being inserted, for example in [[Clasped Weft Weaving]] where a single picking action leaves 2 threads in the resulting fabric.
